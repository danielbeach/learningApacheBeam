Learning Apache Beam with Python

Check out full blog post here https://www.confessionsofadataguy.com/intro-to-apache-beam-for-data-engineers/ 

This is my first script in Python to write an Apache Beam data Pipeline. You will need a sample CSV file to run.

To get started...
- `pip3 install apache-beam`

Then to run the code...
- `python3 pythonWithApacheBeam.py --output output.txt --input 202007-divvy-tripdata.csv`
